# maze-solver
A simple program written in Ruby which indicates the path to the exit of a maze, if it exists

The start point of the maze is the position in the top-left corner, the exit to the maze is the position in bottom-right corner

The maze lives inside the maze.txt and it's represented by 0 values, which indicate a clear path, and 1s, which indicate a wall you can't trespass
